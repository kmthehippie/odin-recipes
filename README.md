# odin-recipes
This is my first Odin project about HTML

This is odin recipes. A project guided by The Odin Project.

I will be demonstrating my amazing ability to use HTML. Wow. Yes. Amazing.

mkdir makes directories for me. 

To add images simply type img src="source" alt="correctly describe image here".

To add links, a href="source.html" /a .

To add unordered lists, use ul /ul.

To add ordered lists, use ol /ol.

To add items to list, use li /li.
