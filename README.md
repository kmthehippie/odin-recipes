# odin-recipes
This is my first Odin project about HTML

This is odin recipes. A project guided by The Odin Project.

I will be demonstrating my amazing ability to use HTML. Wow. Yes. Amazing.

I wish I had better things to add to the readme, but I will just list a simple accumulation of tags I used in this project.

mkdir makes directories for me. 

To add images simply type img src="source" alt="correctly describe image here".

To add links, a href="source.html" /a .

To add unordered lists, use ul /ul.

To add ordered lists, use ol /ol.

To add items to list, use li /li.

I should have looked for shorter recipes. The pho recipe took me so long to copy paste. Cries in ctrl C ctrl V.

I added a link to go back to the index. 

Added titles to recipes and directory for css.

Time to fancy up the page a little bit
